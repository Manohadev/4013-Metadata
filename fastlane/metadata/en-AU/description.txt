Perfect Amora is a gentle relationship planner designed to help couples stay connected, thoughtful, and in sync — without pressure or awkward reminders.

The app helps you organize shared plans, important moments, and everyday details that matter in a relationship. Create joint plans, keep track of meaningful dates, manage shared checklists, and note personal preferences so nothing important slips through the cracks. Whether it’s planning a date, organizing an event, or remembering the little things your partner loves, everything lives in one calm, easy-to-use space.

Perfect Amora is built around balance and communication. Each section is simple and intentional, helping both partners contribute equally. You can plan together, assign responsibilities, and see progress clearly, without turning your relationship into a task list.

The warm design and guided onboarding make the experience feel supportive rather than formal. Instead of control or pressure, Perfect Amora encourages care, attention, and consistency — the small actions that build trust over time.

It’s not about perfection. It’s about being present, thoughtful, and growing together, one shared moment at a time.
